# Predicting Employee Churn with Linear Models
Logistic Regression on HR data

A data consulting/ analytics company has asked us to develop a model to predict why high performing employees are leaving at a higher rate. This notebook will process the data given and the markdowns will explain what is happening and what insights can be drawn here.

# Files

Data loading, exploration, visualization and analysis for the project can be found in the Jupyter Notebok HR_assignment.ipynb, which uses Google Colab to load in the dataset from my Google Drive.

The script version of the notebook is hr_assignment.py and contains code for the analysis and the modeling to be performed.

# Running It

To run the script:
